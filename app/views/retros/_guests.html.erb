    Adding a guest link will allow a participant to join the retro with just a link, but it will be a
    temporary account. Anybody with the link will be able to participate in the retro and see the results.
    The link will not work to join the retro once the retro is complete, but will allow anybody with
    the link to view the retro results.
  </p>
  <%= link_to "Create guest link", "/retros/#{@retro.id}/add_guest_link", class: "btn btn-secondary" %>
<% else %>
  <script>
    function copyLink() {
      navigator.clipboard.writeText("<%= "#{Rails.configuration.url_prefix}/guest/#{@retro.guest_link}" %>");
    }
  </script>
  <div class="input-group mt-3 mb-3">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" value="<%= "#{Rails.configuration.url_prefix}/guest/#{@retro.guest_link}" %>" readonly />
    <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary" type="button" onclick="copyLink(); this.innerHTML='Copied!';">Copy URL</button>
  </div>
  <p>
    Deleting the guest link will stop guest users from joining the retro, but won't block ones already
    in. A retro that is complete won't allow for guests to join, but will allow anyone with the link
    to see the completed retro.
  </p>
  <%= link_to "Delete guest link", "/retros/#{@retro.id}/remove_guest_link", class: "btn btn-secondary" %>
